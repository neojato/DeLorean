          <strong>About GDG/WTM:</strong> On a global scale, a GDG/WTM is voluntarily ran by individuals in their local developer community; as a place to learn about Google technologies and tools for developers, 
          a place to see what local companies and developers are doing with these technologies, focused on developers and educational technical content. Monthly events are open to the public at no charge.

          Being a volunteer/nonprofit organization, our group relies heavily on sponsorships from local companies. These sponsorships come in many forms; providing food/drinks at monthly meetings, giveaways/swag, 
          travel arrangements for a non-local speaker, annual {{ site.eventName }} conference venue/food/swag/etc fees, a venue for monthly meeting, etc. 
          Through past contributions, {{ site.name }} has been able to bring the aforementioned and many other technologies and topics to hundreds of members here in the {{ site.location }} area over the past years. 
          As a sponsor, your company gains exposure to hundreds of people in the {{ site.location }} area (and beyond) via our local group and social media channels.
